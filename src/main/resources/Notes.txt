Spring container instantiates all the beans during initialization by default.
And then, when we do a getBean(), it returns the reference of that object.

Bean scopes:
1. Singleton: only once per Spring container. Default
  There is only one object created which spring returns on every call made by the application.
2. Prototype: new bean created with every request or reference(ie new obj for every ref as well).
  New object created with every getBean() call made by the application.
  
  Web-aware context bean scopes:
  1. Request scope: new bean per servlet request.
  2. Session scope: new bean per session.
  3. Global scope: new bean per global HTTP session (portlet context)
